# **get_events**

Get events on a resource

Returns the full record for all events that have occurred since the sync token was created.  A `GET` request to the endpoint `/[path_to_resource]/events` can be made in lieu of including the resource ID in the data for the request.  Asana limits a single sync token to 100 events. If more than 100 events exist for a given resource, `has_more: true` will be returned in the response, indicating that there are more events to pull.  *Note: The resource returned will be the resource that triggered the event. This may be different from the one that the events were requested for. For example, a subscription to a project will contain events for tasks contained within the project.*

### Example
```python
import asana
from asana.rest import ApiException
from pprint import pprint

configuration = asana.Configuration()
configuration.access_token = '<YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN>'
api_client = asana.ApiClient(configuration)

# create an instance of the API class
events_api_instance = asana.EventsApi(api_client)
resource = "12345" # str | A resource ID to subscribe to. The resource can be a task, project, or goal.
opts = {
    'sync': "de4774f6915eae04714ca93bb2f5ee81", # str | A sync token received from the last request, or none on first sync. Events will be returned from the point in time that the sync token was generated. *Note: On your first request, omit the sync token. The response will be the same as for an expired sync token, and will include a new valid sync token.If the sync token is too old (which may happen from time to time) the API will return a `412 Precondition Failed` error, and include a fresh sync token in the response.*
    'opt_fields': "action,change,change.action,change.added_value,change.field,change.new_value,change.removed_value,created_at,parent,parent.name,resource,resource.name,type,user,user.name", # list[str] | This endpoint returns a compact resource, which excludes some properties by default. To include those optional properties, set this query parameter to a comma-separated list of the properties you wish to include.
}

try:
    # Get events on a resource
    api_response = events_api_instance.get_events(resource, opts)
    for data in api_response:
        pprint(data)
except ApiException as e:
    print("Exception when calling EventsApi->get_events: %s\n" % e)
```
