class _Webhooks:
    """**Webhooks are currently in BETA - The information here may change.**
    
    Webhooks allow an application to be notified of changes. This is in addition
    to the ability to fetch those changes directly as
    [Events](/developers/api-reference/events) - in fact, Webhooks are just a way
    to receive Events via HTTP POST at the time they occur instead of polling for
    them. For services accessible via HTTP this is often vastly more convenient,
    and if events are not too frequent can be significantly more efficient.
    
    In both cases, however, changes are represented as Event objects - refer to
    the [Events documentation](/developers/api-reference/events) for more
    information on what data these events contain.
    
    **NOTE:** While Webhooks send arrays of Event objects to their target, the
    Event objects themselves contain *only IDs*, rather than the actual resource
    they are referencing. So while a normal event you receive via GET /events
    would look like this:
    
        {\
          "resource": {\
            "id": 1337,\
            "name": "My Task"\
          },\
          "parent": null,\
          "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
          "user": {\
            "id": 1123,\
            "name": "Tom Bizarro"\
          },\
          "action": "changed",\
          "type": "task"\
        }
    
    In a Webhook payload you would instead receive this:
    
        {\
          "resource": 1337,\
          "parent": null,\
          "created_at": "2013-08-21T18:20:37.972Z",\
          "user": 1123,\
          "action": "changed",\
          "type": "task"\
        }
    
    Webhooks themselves contain only the information necessary to deliver the
    events to the desired target as they are generated.

        """Establishing a webhook is a two-part process. First, a simple HTTP POST
        similar to any other resource creation. Since you could have multiple
        webhooks we recommend specifying a unique local id for each target.
        
        Next comes the confirmation handshake. When a webhook is created, we will
        send a test POST to the `target` with an `X-Hook-Secret` header as
        described in the
        [Resthooks Security documentation](http://resthooks.org/docs/security/).
        The target must respond with a `200 OK` and a matching `X-Hook-Secret`
        header to confirm that this webhook subscription is indeed expected.
        
        If you do not acknowledge the webhook's confirmation handshake it will
        fail to setup, and you will receive an error in response to your attempt
        to create it. This means you need to be able to receive and complete the
        webhook *while* the POST request is in-flight.

        Parameters
        ----------
        resource : {Id} A resource ID to subscribe to. The resource can be a task or project.
        target : {String} The URL to receive the HTTP POST.
