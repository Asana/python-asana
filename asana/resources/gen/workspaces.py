class _Workspaces:
    """A _workspace_ is the highest-level organizational unit in Asana. All projects
    and tasks have an associated workspace.
    
    An _organization_ is a special kind of workspace that represents a company.
    In an organization, you can group your projects into teams. You can read
    more about how organizations work on the Asana Guide.
    To tell if your workspace is an organization or not, check its
    `is_organization` property.
    
    Over time, we intend to migrate most workspaces into organizations and to
    release more organization-specific functionality. We may eventually deprecate
    using workspace-based APIs for organizations. Currently, and until after
    some reasonable grace period following any further announcements, you can
    still reference organizations in any `workspace` parameter.

        workspace : {Id} The workspace to fetch objects from.

          Note that unlike in the names of endpoints, the types listed here are
          in singular form (e.g. `task`). Using multiple types is not yet supported.

          empty string is passed in, the API will currently return an empty

          - [count] : {Number} The number of results to return. The default is `20` if this

          If there are fewer results found than requested, all will be returned.
